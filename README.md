# HCA Healthcare Hackathon Website :stethoscope:
In this project, our team was tasked to build a website to showcase their 250 facilities in the U.S. The main goal was to simulate a seamless user experience and have points on the map be scatterable as the user hovers over. 

* Map Setup and Structure: Creates SVG container
* US Map Rendering: D3's geoPath to convert geographic data into SVG paths. Loads US states from TopoJSON file
* Uses D3.js (Data-Driven Documents) to bind HTML/SVG elements. Allows us to manipulate the DOM based on data.
